# Artistry Sandbox
This is a project made during a hackathon Make-a-ton:)

A Decentralized Platform for creators and their fans.

There are different platforms available out there to support creators and fans but we are a decentralized platform that connects creators and their fans without any intermediary involved. This platform onboards all kinds of creators musicians, writers, podcasters and the list continues. The creator is paid in the form of <strong>CELO </strong> tokens for his/her art through a P2P(peer to peer) system and so the platform doesnâ€™t get to decide how much should the creator be paid. It is his/her art that speaks for itself.

The smart contracts are deployed on the Celo Alfajores Test Network and we have used the Metamask wallet for making the transactions.
